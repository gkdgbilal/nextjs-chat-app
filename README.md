This project is powered by [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io).

Download Code > Zip from [the main branch](https://github.com/gkdgbilal/nextjs-chat-app/).

Follow the Video Tutorial [right here](https://chatengine.io).

Push to your own repo and link to [vercel](https://vercel.io).

## Setup Finished Project

Go to [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io) and create a account and project.

Find the Private Key `6873b520-7d04-49c9-8167-bc9e05cb194e` and Project ID `72342bbf-56ed-465c-8585-5c90594fc036` then replace the values with your API keys.

The project has been deleted so those keys won't work anymore.

### `yarn dev`

Install everything with `yarn` then run `yarn dev` to get up and running.
